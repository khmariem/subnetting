# subnetting
Automating the subnetting procedure.

This program manipulates IPv4 addresses; from a start IP address, a corresponding mask and the network configuration with the desired
number of end points per subnet, the IP addresses will be allocated in order to ensure an optimal usage of the IP addresses pool.

For a more detailed explanation of what subnetting is about, I will be soon publishing an article on my medium account (https://medium.com/@mariemkhlifi16).
